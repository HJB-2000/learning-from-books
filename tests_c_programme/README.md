# Magic Calendar Code Challenge

Welcome to the Magic Calendar Code Challenge! In this challenge, you'll be tasked with creating a program that generates a text-based calendar for a given month and year.

## Challenge Description

The goal of this challenge is to create a C program that takes user input for a year and a month (in the range of 1 to 12) and then generates and displays a calendar for that month. The calendar should include the month name, the days of the week (Sun, Mon, Tue, etc.), and the days of the month arranged in a tabular format.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

https://github.com/HJB-2000/learning-from-books/tree/master/tests_c_programme

2. Navigate to the project directory:


3. Compile the C program:


4. Run the program:


5. Follow the prompts to input the year and month for which you want to generate the calendar.

## Requirements

- Your program should be written in C.
- It should handle leap years correctly (February should have 29 days in a leap year).
- The calendar should include the days of the week (Sunday, Monday, etc.).
- The output should be formatted in a tabular format similar to a traditional calendar.
- The program should validate user input for the year and month (e.g., ensure the month is in the range of 1 to 12).
- Document your code with comments for clarity.

## Example Output

Here's an example of what the output of your program might look like:
   September 2023
~~~
	Sun Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat
1 2
3 4 5 6 7 8 9
10 11 12 13 14 15 16
17 18 19 20 21 22 23
24 25 26 27 28 29 30
~~~
